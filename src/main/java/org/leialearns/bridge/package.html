    <title>Package 'bridge'</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Provides a factory with supporting classes that generates implementations of a logical interface whose methods are
    delegated to various helper objects on both sides of an abstraction separation. This can be used to define the
    following facets of a logical object in separate entities: interface, logical class level helper, logical state,
    concrete class level helper, concrete delegation object. In the terminology of this package the logical classes
    form the <em>near side</em> of the bridge and the concrete classes form the <em>far side</em> of the bridge.</p>

<p>In combination with an ORM framework this can be used to create bridged objects, where the logical class level
    helper and the logical state objects are defined exclusively in terms of the logical interface, and where the
    concrete classes consist of the Data Access Object (DAO) and the Data Transfer Object (DTO). The DAO and the DTO
    can be completely oblivious about the logical classes.</p>

<p>The cluster of classes and objects that belong to a particular type can be assembled in Spring.</p>
